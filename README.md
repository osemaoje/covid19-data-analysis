### COVID-19 Global Data Analysis
üìä Project Description
This project involves analyzing global COVID-19 trends over time, focusing on cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across various countries. By using real-world data, the project aims to provide insights into how the pandemic has unfolded, the effectiveness of vaccination rollouts, and regional comparisons of COVID-19 metrics.

üéØ ### Project Objectives
Import and clean global COVID-19 data

Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations

Compare COVID-19 metrics across countries and regions

Visualize trends using various charts

Create a Jupyter notebook (or app) to present insights and findings

üõ†Ô∏è ### Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: An interactive development environment to run code and document findings.

pandas: For loading and manipulating COVID-19 data.

matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization, including line charts and bar charts.

plotly: For interactive visualizations, including choropleth maps.

numpy: For numerical operations and calculations.

csv files from Our World in Data: Data source for COVID-19 trends.

üöÄ ### How to Run/View the Project
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, along with the following libraries:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly

jupyter

To install the required libraries, run:

````
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter
````
Running the Project
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the folder containing the project in VS Code or another code editor.

Launch Jupyter Notebook from the terminal:

````
jupyter notebook
````
Open the .ipynb file (e.g., covid19_data_analysis.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells step by step (press Shift + Enter) to execute the code and view the results.

üí° ### Insights and Reflections
Data Quality: The dataset provides valuable insights into the progress of the pandemic, but missing or inconsistent data can sometimes skew the analysis. It‚Äôs important to clean and preprocess the data carefully.

Regional Insights: The project reveals stark differences between countries in terms of vaccination rates, case rates, and deaths, highlighting the global disparity in pandemic response.

Visualization: Interactive charts and maps, especially with Plotly, allow a clearer understanding of trends across regions. Visualizations are key in communicating complex patterns and insights effectively.
